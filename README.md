# project
I am working on the Defender C project for my 3rd term coursework.
I've now fully implemented the main mechanics of the game (scrolling, acceleration, alien AI, mutant aliens, astronauts, collisions, shooting, etc).

In order to execute the project follow the instructions below:

1. Maximise the terminal window

2. Type the following command and press enter to run it:  ./game

3. Enjoy


Game Controls:

Arrow Keys to Move
Space to shoot
Q to quit the game
